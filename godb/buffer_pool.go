//level locking (you will not need to worry about this until lab3).

// already stores numPages pages), a page should be evicted.  Should not evict
// pages that are dirty, as this would violate NO STEAL. If the buffer pool is
// full of dirty pages, you should return an error. For lab 1, you do not need to
// implement locking or deadlock detection. [For future labs, before returning the page,
// attempt to lock it with the specified permission. If the lock is
// unavailable, should block until the lock is free. If a deadlock occurs, abort
