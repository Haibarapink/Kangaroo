/* HeapPage implements the Page interface for pages of HeapFiles. We have
provided our interface to HeapPage below for you to fill in, but you are not
required to implement these methods except for the three methods that the Page
interface requires.  You will want to use an interface like what we provide to
implement the methods of [HeapFile] that insert, delete, and iterate through
tuples.

In GoDB all tuples are fixed length, which means that given a TupleDesc it is
possible to figure out how many tuple "slots" fit on a given page.

In addition, all pages are PageSize bytes.  They begin with a header with a 32
bit integer with the number of slots (tuples), and a second 32 bit integer with
the number of used slots.

Each tuple occupies the same number of bytes.  You can use the go function
unsafe.Sizeof() to determine the size in bytes of an object.  So, a GoDB integer
(represented as an int64) requires unsafe.Sizeof(int64(0)) bytes.  For strings,
we encode them as byte arrays of StringLength, so they are size
((int)(unsafe.Sizeof(byte('a')))) * StringLength bytes.  The size in bytes  of a
tuple is just the sum of the size in bytes of its fields.

Once you have figured out how big a record is, you can determine the number of
slots on on the page as:

remPageSize = PageSize - 8 // bytes after header
numSlots = remPageSize / bytesPerTuple //integer division will round down

To serialize a page to a buffer, you can then:

write the number of slots as an int32
write the number of used slots as an int32
write the tuples themselves to the buffer

You will follow the inverse process to read pages from a buffer.

Note that to process deletions you will likely delete tuples at a specific
position (slot) in the heap page.  This means that after a page is read from
disk, tuples should retain the same slot number. Because GoDB will never evict a
dirty page, it's OK if tuples are renumbered when they are written back to disk.
